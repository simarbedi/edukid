The most effective way of learning and teaching oneself is using visual format. It is a well-known fact that one learns much faster from visual data rather that textual date. Learning from your surroundings is also one of the quickest ways to learn and grasp knowledge.

It is a kids educational website for interaction purpose and learning from each other and their surroundings. It has a feature of image captioning which describes them the different objects or scenario's so they can improve their vocabulary.

## The webapp main features:

Image Captioning is a process of generating textual description of an image. It uses machine learning to extract image features and describing it. It is one of the essential features for children to learn from the world in a fun and enjoyable manner moving one step closer to success.

Learning through images and with peers is the best method to achieve knowledge, and this is what the platform helps to achieve by bringing like-minded people together and getting knowledge for the quick start of educating oneself. Learning from each otherâ€™s experiences is one of the best methodologies for better and long-term grasp of knowledge.

This project has been inspired by some of the real-life experiences of me and my friends, primarily when we took care some of some children and taught them some basics and gave them a beginner education, to improve their knowledge and understanding of the current society.

### Future Scope:
*	Use Advanced Deep Learning techniques 
*	Deploying into production
*	Converting it to be easily used as an API
*	Find and use better quality data.
*	Enhancing the parameters of the model
*	Use and implement new techniques that are being researched
*	Increasing the accuracy of Model and being able to deliver better Results 
*	Using Better Datasets
